# UFair-Implementation
In this repo I have provided the initial coding of UFair.
##
test-stage1.py

This is the modified version of stage 1. In this version,unlike previous one, the amount of parameters {a, b, c} are different for each resolution. In general, three types of resolution has been considered {1080p, 720p, 360p}. Moreover, {r_max} is also different for each stream.
This is only a test code for the stage 1. The original function along with other related functions will be posted!
